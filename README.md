# Machine & Deep Learning From Scratch

This repository contains various machine and deep learning architectures built from scratch. Helper libraries such as `NumPy` were used, however, libraries built specifically for machine learning (such as `Scikit-learn`) were not utilized, as the purpose of this project is to act as an alternative to such libraries. Below is a list of the featured architectures, which includes the name of the architecture, the type of learning (supervised vs unsupervised, regression vs classification vs clustering), and a brief description of what the architecture does. 

| Name | Type | Brief Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Linear Regression | Supervised, Regression | Linear Regression models a linear relationship between a dependent variable (also known as target/output) and one or more independent variables (also known as features or inputs). The model finds a best-fit line through the data points which can be used to predict additional outputs. |
